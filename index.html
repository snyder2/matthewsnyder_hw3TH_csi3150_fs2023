        <p>"This was a fantastic experience, we saw so much, the wildlife, the scenery and met interesting people and really got to know Alaska! It really was the best way to see Alaska! We loved getting out onto the galcier with the crampons. My daughter loved the ice climbing. Sea kayaking was great. Thank you for a memorable, unique trip!"</p>
